# SpacexChallengeReactFrontend

Repository contains a trivial react front end code. It is my first project in ReactJS. Hence lot of improvements are possible and necessary.
This is a frontend to the rest service provided in http://sie-space-x-challenge-rest-service-env.eba-32pahimi.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/ (repository: https://github.com/ajishasafali/SpacexChallenge)
The application provides few insights to the SpaceX company's Dragons and Crew.
The application is currently hosted via AWS EBS, url: http://sie-space-x-challenge-react-frontend-env.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/
